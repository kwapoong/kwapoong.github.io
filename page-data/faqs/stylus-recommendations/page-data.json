Paired with an iPad Pro it’s the closest thing to drawing <em>for real</em>.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"/mastering-paper/pencil-53-review/\"><strong>Pencil by FiftyThree</strong></a></td>\n<td>Super reliable, well designed, and long battery life. Tips tend to tare quickly, but they’re replaceable.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"/mastering-paper/pogo-connect-smart-pen/\"><strong>Ten One Design Pogo Connect</strong></a></td>\n<td>Connectivity issues and hardware flaws are maddening to deal with. Ignoring these problems, apps with pressure sensitivity support perform well.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"http://amzn.to/2ugpp0U\"><strong>LunaTik Alloy Touch Pen</strong></a></td>\n<td>My trusted sidekick for a long time. Tip (not replaceable) took some serious abuse and kept on licking. Has a refillable roller ball pen if you need a traditional writing instrument.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"http://amzn.to/2GictfT\"><strong>Just-Mobile AluPen</strong></a></td>\n<td>Wears out after a few months of use. Nice solid construction. Tips aren’t replaceable.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/zenwriting/zen-next-generation-of-modern-writing-instrument\"><strong>ZEN 3 in 1</strong></a></td>\n<td>Precision disc tip dead on arrival so I couldn’t test that. Rubber nib seems well made and slightly smaller than others giving a bit more precision to your draws.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"http://amzn.to/2ILeVJZ\"><strong>Chalkee Series Kids Stylus</strong></a></td>\n<td>Good for kids with small hands. Tip isn’t replaceable and wears out fast.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"http://amzn.to/2IFHOY9\"><strong>Universal Touch Screen Pen</strong></a></td>\n<td>Cheap, small, light, and pretty crappy. Comes in a 3 pack that are good as backup styli.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The first iPad stylus I purchased was a <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2GictfT\">Just-Mobile AluPen</a> and used it for some time before the rubber tip wore out. Following it I ended up with a <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2ugpp0U\">LunaTik Alloy Touch Pen</a> after winning one in an <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20120822201917/http://lunatiklife.com/features/post/lunatikonpaper-winners\">art competition</a>.</p>\n<p>I like the Touch Pen because of its solid construction. The tip isn’t a squishy rubber nib and is super durable. I’ve drawn close to 400 portraits with it and it works as flawless as the day I got it. I’d still be using it if I hadn’t been lured over to the dark-side of Bluetooth styli.</p>\n<p>Speaking of Bluetooth styli, before Apple Pencil, <a href=\"/mastering-paper/pencil-53-review/\">FiftyThree’s Pencil</a> was my go to when using <a href=\"https://fiftythree.com/paper\"><strong>Paper</strong></a>. Before that, I was all about the <a href=\"/mastering-paper/pogo-connect-smart-pen/\">Pogo Connect Smart Pen</a> — even if it’s a piece of crap.</p>","excerpt":"Long story short, if you have an iPad Pro do yourself a favor and get an Apple Pencil.
