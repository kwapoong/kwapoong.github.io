For this portrait I decided to make one of those most excellent speed drawing videos you see all over YouTube. In the past I used AirPlay on my iPad to mirror its display to my iMac that was running <a href=\"http://www.airsquirrels.com/reflector/\"><strong>Reflector</strong></a> to capture the screen. This process has worked out great but since it only records the screen you miss out on actually seeing how I draw with a stylus.</p>\n<p>To record the video below I used some knowledge I picked up last year when I created a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXd5oe_vOBE\">pregnancy time lapse</a> of <a href=\"https://2littlerosebuds.com\">my wife and twin girls</a>. Basically I setup my dSLR camera on a tripod behind me and tethered it to my iMac through a USB cable so I could use software to snap photographs every couple of seconds.</p>\n<p>After grabbing around 1,000 images I imported them into <strong>Adobe AfterEffects</strong> as an image sequence, did some quick color corrections, added titles and music, and uploaded to YouTube.</p>\n<p><div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.42857142857143%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; \" > <div class=\"embedVideo-container\"> <iframe data-src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FGCPOimgdb4?rel=0\" class=\"embedVideo-iframe lazyload\" style=\"border:0; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \" allowfullscreen></iframe> </div> </div></p>\n<p>The lighting kind of sucks and the focus is off in a few parts, but I think it came out ok for my second time lapse attempt. Next time I’ll take more care to get my white balance correct upfront and make sure I don’t bump into the tripod midway through the shoot.</p>\n<p><strong>Tools used:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009K448L4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#x26;camp=1789&#x26;creative=390957&#x26;creativeASIN=B009K448L4&#x26;linkCode=as2&#x26;tag=mademist-20\">Pogo Connect Bluetooth Smart Pen</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://paper.bywetransfer.com/\">Paper for iOS</a></li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"PaperFaces portrait of @LizzieBeth_.
