Going in I knew <strong>Animal Crossing: City Folk</strong> (for the Nintendo Wii) would be remaining mostly unchanged from its predecessor AC: Wild World on the DS. But frankly I didn’t care and wanted to try it out for myself even after reading a few lackluster reviews. What really surprised me after playing was how it was able to hook me in…again. Which is pretty admirable seeing how it’s the same damn game I’ve played TWICE before.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Animal Crossing</strong> series has always been able to take boring tasks like paying a mortgage, picking weeds, making deliveries, planting flowers and trees, cleaning up trash, fishing, digging up fossils, catching bugs…and transform them into fun. The charm of the game is its ability to introduce new “carrots” along the way that encourage you to continue playing. Payoff your first mortgage to Tom Nook and you’ll see exactly what I mean.</p>\n<p>The following are some of the additions and changes to the series that have for the most part won me over.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-you-play\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#how-you-play\" aria-label=\"how you play permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>How you play</h2>\n<p>In the Gamecube and DS versions, <em>time traveling</em> or <abbr title=\"time traveling\">TT</abbr> was frowned upon. If you forgot to save before turning off your game or if you changed the internal clock, Resetti would popup and drone on about the ill effects of not saving properly. <abbr title=\"time traveling\">TT</abbr>’ing was mostly used to make money quick with the drawback of having a ton of weeds and bugs in your house to deal with after.</p>\n<p>In City Folk I’ve been known to <abbr title=\"time traveling\">TT</abbr> a day or so to catch events I missed. This time around Resetti doesn’t bug you and the game itself makes it easy to change the time before entering your town. If you <abbr title=\"time traveling\">TT</abbr> your turnips will wilt, you will get weeds, you can’t gain interest (unless you change the Wii’s clock in the system settings), and town folk may leave. But used in moderation I see no problem with going back a few hours so you can enter Nook’s or catch special visitors.</p>\n<p>A cool addition is the ability to import your character from <strong>Animal Crossing: Wild World</strong> on the Nintendo DS. Everything you obtained in your catalog makes the move (with the exception of some rare items). You don’t bring over the physical items, house expansions, or accumulated bells. But you can re-purchase any of these items from Nook by asking to see your item catalog.</p>\n<figure>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; background-color: var(--input-background-color); max-width: 500px;\">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 63.272727272727266%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image lazyload\" alt=\"Wendy&apos;s Animal Crossing character lurking over me\" title=\"Wendy&apos;s Animal Crossing character lurking over me\" data-src=\"/static/01286cdd85b9e4c259ea9bf535dba326/bb312/animal-crossing-me-wendy.jpg\" data-srcset=\"/static/01286cdd85b9e4c259ea9bf535dba326/16841/animal-crossing-me-wendy.jpg 275w,\n/static/01286cdd85b9e4c259ea9bf535dba326/bb312/animal-crossing-me-wendy.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </span>\n  <figcaption><p>She knows where I sleep.</p></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>If you don’t have access to the internet, but do have a DS, you can take your character to a friend’s town through a process called <strong>DS Suitcase</strong>. The game essentially saves your character to a DS allowing you to go to a friend’s town, mess around, earn bells/trade items/etc, save back to your DS, and then return to your town at home. Pretty handy if you don’t have an Internet connection to visit a friend via <strong>Nintendo WFC</strong> and want to nab some foreign fruit.</p>\n<p>At first I thought you could transfer your save from the Wii to a SD card and visit this way (similar to the Gamecube game). But sadly you can’t since the save is locked to your console. Although if you installed the Homebrew Channel there are tools that let you transfer it and then edit your town data on a PC. Browsing around on YouTube I found a ton of crazy looking towns and glitches going on. While it might be fun to tinker with your town, I don’t really see the point if you want to get the most enjoyment out of Animal Crossing. Getting rich quick and having all the rare stuff right away defeats the purpose of playing the game. Meh…</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-town-stuff\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-town-stuff\" aria-label=\"the town stuff permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The town stuff</h2>\n<p>For the most part everything functions and looks like it did in Wild World. The exceptions being you can now have a fountain, windmill (helps with perfect town status), or lighthouse (helps bring in rare fish) built by donating enough bells to the town fund.</p>\n<figure>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; background-color: var(--input-background-color); max-width: 896px;\">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 53.45454545454545%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image lazyload\" alt=\"Dharma flag from LOST in Animal Crossing\" title=\"Dharma flag from LOST in Animal Crossing\" data-src=\"/static/ededca8217a05a2894a741c84d167333/968f2/animal-crossing-dharma-initiative-house.jpg\" data-srcset=\"/static/ededca8217a05a2894a741c84d167333/16841/animal-crossing-dharma-initiative-house.jpg 275w,\n/static/ededca8217a05a2894a741c84d167333/50c97/animal-crossing-dharma-initiative-house.jpg 550w,\n/static/ededca8217a05a2894a741c84d167333/968f2/animal-crossing-dharma-initiative-house.jpg 896w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 896px) 100vw, 896px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </span>\n  <figcaption><p>I created a Dharma Initiative flag from LOST.</p></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>I like how you can still customize the gate’s flag and place patterns on the ground — to do some really creative paths. Pattern making has been enhanced allowing you to create what are called <em>Pro Designs</em>. Now you can design clothing and work on the front, back, and sides independently to do elaborate and realistic costumes.</p>\n<p>What I don’t like is how your house expands. Instead of building rooms off of the house like in Wild World, you get additional floors. I suppose it’s nice to have a basement again but having a kitchen on the second floor doesn’t really make a whole heck of sense does it?</p>\n<p>Another small change is the floating balloons that appear randomly during the day. In WW they floated above the horizon and you’d hear a blowing wind sound effect. In City Folk they hover directly above you and a shadow can be seen on the ground below it.</p>\n<p>A feature I thought was cool at first has caused quite the uproar in the AC community. Walking the same route daily will wear the grass or snow away, leaving a dirt path in its wake. The effects aren’t obvious until you quit for the day, but the ground does wear away and look like sand. The developers thought this would help visiting friends find their way through your town. At first I thought it might grow back, but I’m pretty sure it doesn’t. Lame.</p>\n<h2 id=\"controlling-stuff\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#controlling-stuff\" aria-label=\"controlling stuff permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Controlling stuff</h2>\n<p>Using the Wiimote and nun-chuck combo is so much better than the DS d-pad and stylus combo.

Works just like Wild World — you register friend codes and then you can open your gates or travel to only their towns. You can add other people to your list if they happen to be in a town you’re visiting, but that’s about it. No hub to meet other people in your extended circles — no nothing.</p>\n<p>I get it — Nintendo wants to keep it family friendly and safe by sticking with this awful friend code business. But why in the world do you force me to check with Copper every time I want to see if a friend is online? Why can’t the Wii be online all the time and notify me when a friend is available ala Xbox Live or any other online service? Get with it Nintendo! Guess that’s what you get when you duct tape two Gamecubes together…</p>\n<p><div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.42857142857143%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; \" > <div class=\"embedVideo-container\"> <iframe data-src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aF78u3LQduw?rel=0\" class=\"embedVideo-iframe lazyload\" style=\"border:0; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \" allowfullscreen></iframe> </div> </div></p>\n<h3 id=\"removed-wild-world-features\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#removed-wild-world-features\" aria-label=\"removed wild world features permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Removed Wild World features?</h3>\n<p>I haven’t come across these yet so I’m not sure if they were removed or what.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Faceless character that asks for a new face.</li>\n<li>Missing cats that randomly need finding.</li>\n<li>Bottled messages that wash up on your beach.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"closing-thoughts\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#closing-thoughts\" aria-label=\"closing thoughts permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Closing thoughts</h2>\n<p>I wonder with Microsoft trying to make the Xbox 360 appeal to the casual gamer, if they will ever create a true Animal Crossing clone? When <strong>Viva Pinata</strong> came out I thought that maybe it was their answer to Animal Crossing. Well not really seeing how all the fun stuff in Animal Crossing was nowhere to be found in Viva Pinata. I can only hope they’re working on a true rip-off of the Animal Crossing franchise that has full avatar support and is backed by Xbox Live’s excellent online experience. Oh and lots of achievements… damn that would be an amazing game.</p>\n<p>That being said. Feel free to add my friend code and town information if you have <strong>Animal Crossing: City Folk</strong>. Leave a comment with your friend code and I’ll add you. Always looking for more people to play with since it can be hard to find open towns late at night.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; background-color: var(--input-background-color); max-width: 500px;\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 54.18181818181819%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image lazyload\"\n        alt=\"My Animal Crossing friend code\"\n        title=\"My Animal Crossing friend code\"\n        data-src=\"/static/7bb695d49c149cafe78e3c103503f893/bb312/animal-crossing-friend-code.jpg\"\n        data-srcset=\"/static/7bb695d49c149cafe78e3c103503f893/16841/animal-crossing-friend-code.jpg 275w,\n/static/7bb695d49c149cafe78e3c103503f893/bb312/animal-crossing-friend-code.jpg 500w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<div class=\"custom-block notice\"><div class=\"custom-block-heading\">La mer in Beetus</div><div class=\"custom-block-body\"><p><strong>Friend Code:</strong> 4769-1328-3546.
