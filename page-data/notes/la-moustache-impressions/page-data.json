At first he thinks his wife is playing an elaborate prank on him but things gradually progress to a state of great disorientation for Marc.</p>\n<p>His coworkers deny that he ever had a mustache even though he has photos of him wearing one. His wife tells him his father died the year before, when five minutes earlier she was talking about going to see them for dinner. All kinds of head scratching events occur as you witness Marc’s madness.</p>\n<p>The acting and music are all really good.
