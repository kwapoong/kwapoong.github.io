In college I tired of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Typographic_Style\" title=\"International Typographic Style\">Swiss style</a> every one of my peers was regurgitating in <em>Typography I</em> and <em>II</em>. What excited me more, was mashing analog approaches of zine and <abbr title=\"Do It Yourself\">DIY</abbr> record packaging design with refined digital methods and craftsmanship. Focusing less on the gloss and more on the method, gave me a greater appreciation of texture and how to communicate with it.</p>\n<p>Instead of embarrassing myself with examples of my early fumbles as a graphic designer — I’d like to share inspirational fragments from my record collection. With over 500 LP’s and 45’s, I’m sure I can find plenty of material to critique and comment on.</p>\n<h2 id=\"more-to-come\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#more-to-come\" aria-label=\"more to come permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>More to come</h2>\n<p>Just finished capturing some photographs of artwork that ranges from black/white ink drawings, fancy die-cuts, to sleeves printed on vellum with metallic inks…</p>","excerpt":"Most of the records I purchased in the late 90’s–early 2000’s were self-released or put out by small independent labels.
