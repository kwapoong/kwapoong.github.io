This tool sets Paper apart from other apps by replicating the natural feel of pushing and pulling paint across a canvas. Without it I wouldn’t be able to shade, paint skies, or render hair realistically at all.</p>\n<div class=\"custom-block notice\"><div class=\"custom-block-heading\">ProTip: manipulate the brush’s size</div><div class=\"custom-block-body\"><p>While there is no obvious way to change the size of your brush in Paper by FiftyThree, you can make thinner lines when used with a pressure sensitive stylus like the Pogo Connect Smart Pen. Pressing lightly will make a line about a 1/4th as thick as the default one. <a href=\"/mastering-paper/pencil-53-review/\">FiftyThree’s Pencil</a> stylus also allows you to dynamically change brush size depending on how you hold it.</p></div></div>\n<p>It helps to think of your stylus tip as a brush loaded with watered down paint. Because the paint has been thinned it won’t be as intense or saturated as the color from one of the pens. Instead you need to build up color in multiple layers.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; background-color: var(--input-background-color); max-width: 700px;\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 44.36363636363637%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image lazyload\"\n        alt=\"Choppy painting versus consistent painting watercolor swatches in Paper app\"\n        title=\"Choppy painting versus consistent painting watercolor swatches in Paper app\"\n        data-src=\"/static/d4e818cebb31488e283c0e6092c8cc2c/43804/paper-53-watercolor-even-fill.jpg\"\n        data-srcset=\"/static/d4e818cebb31488e283c0e6092c8cc2c/16841/paper-53-watercolor-even-fill.jpg 275w,\n/static/d4e818cebb31488e283c0e6092c8cc2c/50c97/paper-53-watercolor-even-fill.jpg 550w,\n/static/d4e818cebb31488e283c0e6092c8cc2c/43804/paper-53-watercolor-even-fill.jpg 700w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>This “thinned out” behavior also factors into how even of a coat you can apply. <em>Moving the brush faster</em> doesn’t let the paint fully cover a spot and will make it appear choppy. While <em>moving slowly</em> allows the paint to flow evenly off the brush and build into a dark even value. Mastering the speed at which you apply color is essential to creating even tones and shading.</p>\n<p>It may be helpful to create a few color scales with the primary colors, gray, and black to practice.
