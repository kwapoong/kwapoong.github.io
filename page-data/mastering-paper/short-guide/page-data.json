I use the square as a rough guide for the composition because I like the look of shapes and lines bleeding outside the border. An alternative would be to use the eraser to straighten up the edges, if you like things neat and tidy. You could of course forgo the square and fill the entire page — whatever works for you.</p>\n<p>Usually I pencil in quick gestural outlines as a guide for painting forms later. Other times I jump right to the background and splash in layer upon layer of watercolor. It really depends on the source material and if the background has enough detail to bother with.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; background-color: var(--input-background-color); max-width: 1024px;\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 61.45454545454545%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image lazyload\"\n        alt=\"Screenshot of an in progress Paper for iOS drawing\"\n        title=\"Screenshot of an in progress Paper for iOS drawing\"\n        data-src=\"/static/d9d034719d7276677672bd150749e35e/e95b5/girl-madewithpaper-in-progress.jpg\"\n        data-srcset=\"/static/d9d034719d7276677672bd150749e35e/16841/girl-madewithpaper-in-progress.jpg 275w,\n/static/d9d034719d7276677672bd150749e35e/50c97/girl-madewithpaper-in-progress.jpg 550w,\n/static/d9d034719d7276677672bd150749e35e/e95b5/girl-madewithpaper-in-progress.jpg 1024w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<h2 id=\"watercolor-without-water\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#watercolor-without-water\" aria-label=\"watercolor without water permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Watercolor without water</h2>\n<p>If you ask me, this tool is what sets Paper for iOS apart from all the other iPad drawing apps like <strong>Procreate</strong> and <strong>Sketchbook Pro</strong>. I use the watercolor brush in two ways… well maybe three.</p>\n<p>When crisp edges aren’t a concern, I’ll block in color with the watercolor brush. I achieve continuous tones by painting slowly and never removing the stylus (or my finger) from the screen. If I want to create a smooth gradation in color I move the brush progressively faster to fade it out.</p>\n<h3 id=\"highlights-and-shadows\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#highlights-and-shadows\" aria-label=\"highlights and shadows permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Highlights and shadows</h3>\n<p>Brightening existing areas is achieved with the watercolor brush. Mix enough white into a color and the brush can be used to lighten. This technique is perfect for adding highlights or correcting mistakes when an eraser’s edges might be too harsh. When working with white my general rule of thumb is to move fast. If you stick around in one location too long it’ll lighten too fast. The same is true when using full black…</p>\n<p>To shade existing areas apply a darker hue, gray, or black. For backgrounds I tend to use a light blue-gray to paint in shadows. I prefer to start light and layer glazes to add depth and contrast gradually. When working on a subjects’ face, I’ll use a dull brown to add dimension and shape. Applying a coat of gray or brown works wonders on hair as well.</p>\n<h2 id=\"filling-shapes-with-ink\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#filling-shapes-with-ink\" aria-label=\"filling shapes with ink permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Filling shapes with ink</h2>\n<p>I don’t use the fountain pen or marker tools all that much because I like my illustrations to have a more painterly feel to them.

When I first started using Paper for iOS, I was enamored with the thick and thins of the fountain pen and how true to life the watercolor brush handled. But then I rediscovered an old friend, in a digital world — Mr. Pencil.</p>\n<p>Need to lightly sketch out a face… pull out the pencil. Need to smoothen out some edges… pull out the pencil. Need to add shadows and highlights… pull out the pencil.</p>\n<p>It has so many uses, that by default I spend most of my time with it. My absolute favorite is to use a white on top of a black (or dark background) and sketch in highlights.

Pressing down on the tip while drawing registers as an input with\nPaper, while lightly gliding the tip across the screen might not.</p>\n<p>There is a spring in the tip that I can only guess aids in decipher touches\nversus non touches. Paper tries to be smart about these touches too which is why\nsometimes you might observe a blend or stroke disappear or correct itself.</p>\n<p>The more you use Pencil the less it happens, but it can still be quite annoying\neven after getting comfortable with the stylus. A possible solution is to turn\noff the Blend feature until you need it. It’s not ideal, but will solve the\nmisfires. You can modify Pencil’s behavior by tapping the 53 circle in the upper\nright corner, tapping Pencil, and then flipping Finger between “Blend” and\n“Nothing” depending on if you want to use it or not.”</p>"}},{"node":{"id":"8baf901b-23ae-5212-92ee-0264e8d37df7","frontmatter":{"name":"Rahat","email":null,"friendlyDate":"April 11, 2014","iso8601Date":"2014-04-11T21:41:07.000Z","published":null},"html":"<p>Hi Michael, Thanks for your advise.
