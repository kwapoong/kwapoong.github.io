Because of the wide and flat shape, I did find it uncomfortable to hold at first. Although after a few drawing sessions it wasn’t a concern as my hand adapted to the contour of Pencil.</p>\n<p>Between the two finishes, Walnut is lighter and softer to the touch with a wood texture allowing for more grip. Because of Graphite’s slick finish I occasionally had to readjust how I held it. When trying to fill in large continuous tones of watercolor I noticed it slipping the most. Slightly annoying sure, but not a deal breaker by any means.</p>\n<p>Similar to Paper, Pencil shares the same minimally designed aesthetic — that means no buttons, no battery indicator lights<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup>, and no on/off switches.</p>\n<p>I love how the UI in Paper doesn’t get in your way, and it’s refreshing that Pencil’s design echoes this theme. Common tasks like erasing or <a href=\"/mastering-paper/pencil-first-look/\">blending</a> become more natural, without the need to open the tool tray or press buttons.</p>\n<p>Want to erase something?

No calibration or setup.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In my tests I had no issues drawing with palms resting on the iPad’s screen.

When you want to paint a wider stroke\nyou use the fat side of Pencil just like you would with a paint brush.</li>\n<li>In some circumstances drawing with a Pogo Connect feels more natural. For\nexample the pencil tool. If you were using a real pencil you’d press harder to\nmake a darker line. The same behavior occurs with a Pogo Connect, unlike 53’s\nPencil.</li>\n<li>Learning to use Surface Pressure in a controlled and fluid way can take some\npractice. Sure it’s easy to use the broadside of Pencil to fill in an area\nquickly. But if you want to create a line that varies from thin to thick, in\nan exact and smooth way you have to perform some crazy maneuvers with your\nhand by rotating Pencil’s tip from side to point. Some will argue that\npressing on the tip of a Pogo to do the same thing can be difficult, but I\nalways found it pretty easy to pull off compared to Pencil.</li>\n<li>Overall I think using Pencil and Surface Pressure together is a more enjoyable\nexperience than using a Pogo Connect. I’ve gotten sick of the constant\ndisconnects and manual restarts to get the stupid thing working with Paper.\nNeither styli is perfect in all circumstances.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At this point I wouldn’t bother wasting money on a Pogo because it has some\nserious problems with newer iPad’s since Apple changed the display technology\nbehind the screen.</p>"}},{"node":{"id":"1ae67ea5-f362-5d11-a128-3bf373eee231","frontmatter":{"name":"John S.","email":null,"friendlyDate":"January 15, 2015","iso8601Date":"2015-01-15T15:18:28.000Z","published":null},"html":"<p>I recently got a Pencil 53 for Christmas.
