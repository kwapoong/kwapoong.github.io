Because I’m a finger blender I learned about this next bit from <a href=\"https://mademistakes.tumblr.com/post/98571965783/paper-200-193\">Edwin over on Tumblr</a>. For those of you who prefer using a capacitive stylus like <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2ZXG3AX\">Wacom’s Bamboo</a> to smudge, you may need to change your work-flow after updating Paper to version 2.0.0…</p>\n<p>In my tests this appears to be limited to styli with smaller nibs. In <strong>Paper 2.0.0 (193)</strong>, smudging with these sorts of nibs no longer works… well not 100% of the time. If you press hard enough to “squish” the tip it might register as a touch and smudge but at the cost of wearing out faster.</p>\n<p>I tried several styli with rubber nibs to see if it was indeed the tip’s size or some other quality. As long as the tip is fat enough Paper will interpret it as a finger touch and Blend — and sometimes draw (<a href=\"#pencil-nothing-bug\">see bug below</a>). Anything smaller it ignores as a way of filtering out touches to avoid making errant smudges.</p>\n<div class=\"custom-block notice\"><div class=\"custom-block-heading\">Dumb stylus woes</div><div class=\"custom-block-body\"><p>I’ve also observed Paper getting confused when pressing lightly with a capacitive styli. I’d expect it to Blend or not do anything, but instead it begins drawing marks.</p></div></div>\n<p><div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.42857142857143%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; \" > <div class=\"embedVideo-container\"> <iframe data-src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cleK43E6M6o?rel=0\" class=\"embedVideo-iframe lazyload\" style=\"border:0; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \" allowfullscreen></iframe> </div> </div></p>\n<p>While I believe activating Blend with finger sized touch targets is the intended behavior. I do see how it could be bothersome for those who prefer using a stylus (that falls under the size threshold<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>) to Blend.

I’ve found that a stylus used in place of your finger will <em>draw</em> even if you’ve turned off the Blend feature. Here’s how to reproduce the bug:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Tap Settings in the upper right corner.</li>\n<li>Choose Pencil.</li>\n<li>Set Finger to <strong>Nothing</strong>.</li>\n<li>Make a stroke with Pencil.</li>\n<li>Switch to another stylus and make another stroke.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It doesn’t always draw and it doesn’t happen with every stylus. Capacitive tip styli with smaller tips exhibit it more often than those that are fat and squishy — but not always.</p>\n<div class=\"custom-block notice\"><div class=\"custom-block-heading\">Be mindful of how you hold Pencil</div><div class=\"custom-block-body\"><p>If your palm or another finger depresses the Eraser end of Pencil as you draw it will begin erasing instead.</p></div></div>\n<h2 id=\"pogo-connect-bug\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#pogo-connect-bug\" aria-label=\"pogo connect bug permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Pogo Connect bug</h2>\n<p>I’ve been using my Pogo Connect less and less these days so this bug hasn’t been that troubling for me.
